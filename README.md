## Portfolio

This repository is a portfolio page, customized for the developer.

The page is written in HTML and CSS utilizing flexbox for responsiveness.

To use this repository follow these steps:

*`git clone https://github.com/tpierag1/portfolio.git`

*Customize content to your liking.

*Display by opening in browser, starting a minimal webserver
(I tend to like Python SimpleHttpServer for this), or forward
to your webroot directory for Apache or Nginx
